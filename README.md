Sign-up Form Project
=========================
A simple sign-up form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features
------------

    Responsive design for a smooth user experience across devices
    Validation for required fields, including email and password
    ARIA attributes for improved accessibility
    Modern design with a touch of minimalism

Technologies Used
----------------------

    HTML5 for structuring the form
    CSS3 for styling and layout
    JavaScript for form validation and interactivity

Challenges
-------------

    Working with JavaScript logic to implement form validation and interactivity

What I'd Change Next Time
-------------------------------

    Perform more debugging in the browser console to catch errors and improve code quality

What I Need Help With
---------------------------

    Finding a way to separate certain parts of text (e.g., span elements) onto a new line by making them block-level elements, while maintaining a fixed size for their parent div element. This would allow the parent element to keep its size even when the span element wraps to a new line, while still shrinking with the resizing window.
